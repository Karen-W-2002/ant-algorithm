# Ant Algorithm using Hybrid Programming
An ant colony algorithm implemented with MPI and multithreads

### Compilation
mpiicc -no-multibyte-chars -o ant ant.c -lpthread

### Execution
mpiexec -n (# of processors) ant

### What have you done
Created multiprocessors and then within the processors created multithreads, and the threads are id'd from 0->n with no repeating ids


### Analysis on your result
no results

### Any difficulties?
Everything

### Feedback to TAs
homework too hard
